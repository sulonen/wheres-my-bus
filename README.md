#### This is a Code Fellows Code 301 Team Project
Our aim is to provide a shorter UX path from a King County Metro bus stop
location to a visual representation of the location of an arriving vehicle.

We are using the the [OneBusAway API](http://pugetsound.onebusaway.org/p/OneBusAwayApiService)
in conjunction with the [Google Maps APIs](https://developers.google.com/maps/web/)
to access and manipulate real-time data.
